# Introduction to Physical AI

Physical AI refers to the integration of artificial intelligence with physical systems, such as robots, autonomous vehicles, drones, and smart devices, enabling them to perceive, understand, reason, and interact with the real world in real-time. Unlike traditional AI, which primarily operates in digital environments (e.g., chatbots or image analysis), or generative AI, which focuses on producing content like text or images, Physical AI extends these capabilities by allowing machines to directly intervene and act within the physical world.

These systems are equipped with sensors (like cameras, lidar, microphones, and temperature gauges) to gather real-world data, which is then processed using advanced AI algorithms, including machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. This allows them to make dynamic decisions and execute physical actions through actuators, adapting to complex and unpredictable environments.

Key applications of Physical AI include robotic arms in manufacturing, autonomous vehicles navigating roads, drones surveying terrain, and AI-powered exoskeletons assisting in rehabilitation. The ultimate goal of Physical AI is to bridge the gap between digital intelligence and the physical world, allowing machines to adapt and respond to three-dimensional environments and their inherent physical dynamics.
