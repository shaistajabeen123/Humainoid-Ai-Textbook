# Specification for Module 3: Robot Kinematics

## 1. Overview

This module will introduce the fundamental concepts of robot kinematics, which is the study of the motion of robots without considering the forces that cause it. The content will cover both forward and inverse kinematics, which are essential for controlling the position and orientation of a robot's end-effector.

## 2. Target Audience

- Aspiring robotics engineers.
- Students in mechanical engineering, computer science, or related fields.
- Hobbyists interested in building and programming robotic arms.

## 3. Learning Objectives

Upon completing this module, the reader should be able to:
- Understand the concept of degrees of freedom (DOF).
- Define and use coordinate frames.
- Perform forward kinematics to determine the end-effector's position and orientation from given joint angles.
- Understand the challenges of inverse kinematics.
- Apply geometric and analytical methods to solve inverse kinematics for simple robotic arms.

## 4. Scope

### In Scope:
- Degrees of Freedom (DOF)
- Coordinate frames and transformations.
- Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) parameters for forward kinematics.
- Geometric solutions for inverse kinematics of 2-DOF and 3-DOF planar manipulators.
- Introduction to analytical solutions for inverse kinematics.

### Out of Scope:
- Differential kinematics (Jacobians).
- Velocity and acceleration analysis.
- Kinematics of parallel manipulators.
- Advanced numerical methods for inverse kinematics.
- Dynamics and control theory.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- The module must contain at least two chapters.
- The content must include clear explanations, mathematical formulas, and diagrams.
- At least one chapter must be dedicated to forward kinematics and one to inverse kinematics.
- Code examples or pseudocode for calculations should be included where appropriate.
