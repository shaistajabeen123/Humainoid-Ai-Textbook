## Prompt

/sp.tasks Minimal theory, maximum implementation clarity

## Response snapshot

I have successfully generated the `tasks.md` file for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book" project.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Tasks for the project are clearly defined and actionable.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were generated in this step.
- 📁 Files: `specs/002-humanoid-robotics-book/tasks.md` was created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Next step is to implement the tasks using `/sp.implement`.
- 🧠 Reflection: The instruction "Minimal theory, maximum implementation clarity" was applied during task generation, resulting in direct and actionable steps.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Not applicable.
- Prompt variant (if applicable): None.
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): None.
