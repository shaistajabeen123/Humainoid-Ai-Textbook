# Tasks: Web-based 3D Sensor Simulation

## Phase 1: Setup

- [X] T001 Create `index.html` file.
- [X] T002 Create `main.js` file.
- [X] T003 Add `three.js` library to the project.

## Phase 2: User Story 1 - Basic 3D Scene

- [X] T004 Set up the basic scene, camera, and renderer in `main.js`.
- [X] T005 Add lighting to the scene.
- [X] T006 Add a cube and a sphere to the scene.
- [X] T007 Implement an animation loop to render the scene.

## Phase 3: User Story 2 - LiDAR Simulation

- [X] T008 Implement a LiDAR sensor that casts rays from a central point.
- [X] T009 Visualize the LiDAR intersection points as a point cloud.

## Phase 4: User Story 3 - Depth Camera Simulation

- [X] T010 Implement a depth camera that captures depth information from the scene.
- [X] T011 Display the depth map on the screen.
