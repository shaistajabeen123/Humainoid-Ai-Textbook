# Research: AI Model for Content Generation

## Decision

We will use the Gemini family of models for generating technical content for the book.

## Rationale

Gemini models are well-suited for this task due to their strong capabilities in understanding and generating nuanced, technical text. Their ability to process and reason about complex topics makes them a good choice for a book on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

## Alternatives Considered

-   **GPT-3/4**: A strong alternative, but for this project, we will proceed with Gemini to align with the project's ecosystem.
