# Prompt

Where is module 4 ki sp.specify

# Response

I've created the initial specification for `004-module-4`, but I need your input on a few points to complete it.

I have created:
- A new branch: `004-module-4`
- A specification file: `specs/004-module-4/spec.md`
- A quality checklist: `specs/004-module-4/checklists/requirements.md`

Please answer the following questions to resolve the ambiguities in the specification.

## Question 1: Module Title

**Context**: In `specs/004-module-4/spec.md`: "[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the topic/title of Module 4? This will be used for the sidebar label and directory metadata.]"

**What we need to know**: What is the title of Module 4?

| Option | Answer | Implications |
|---|---|---|
| A | "Advanced Concepts" | The module will be positioned as advanced material. |
| B | "Practical Applications" | The module will focus on real-world use cases. |
| C | "Module 4: The Next Step" | A generic but clear title. |
| Custom | Provide your own answer | The title will be set to your custom input. |

**Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_

## Question 2: Chapter Title

**Context**: In `specs/004-module-4/spec.md`: "[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the title of the first chapter in Module 4?]"

**What we need to know**: What should be the title of the first chapter?

| Option | Answer | Implications |
|---|---|---|
| A | "Introduction to [Module Title]" | A standard introductory chapter. |
| B | "Core Principles" | The chapter will cover fundamental concepts. |
| C | "Chapter 1: Getting Started" | A generic but clear chapter title. |
| Custom | Provide your own answer | The title will be set to your custom input. |
